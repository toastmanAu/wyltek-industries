## [DONE] ckbfs-wasm-browser-adapter
**Priority:** HIGH
**Output:** findings/ckbfs-wasm-browser-adapter.md
**Goal:** Design and spec a WebAssembly adapter that compiles our CKB-ESP32 CKBFS C implementation to WASM, enabling the same codebase to run in browsers and React apps. This is the foundation for `@wyltek/ckbfs` npm package — one C codebase, two targets (ESP32 + browser).

**Context:**
- We have a complete CKBFS implementation in C: `CKB-ESP32/src/ckbfs.h` + `ckbfs.cpp`
- Pure functions (build_witness, build_cell_data, adler32, fetch_witness) compile to WASM today with zero changes
- Platform-specific layer (HTTP = HTTPClient on ESP32, signing = secp256k1 raw key) needs thin JS shims for browser
- JoyID/MetaMask signing stays in JS via CCC signer — WASM just builds the tx skeleton + witness bytes
- End goal: drop-in CKBFS storage provider in the DOB minter (`lib/storage/ckbfs.js`)

- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toastmanAu/CKB-ESP32/main/src/ckbfs.cpp

**Questions to answer:**
1. What is the minimal Emscripten build config to compile ckbfs.h pure functions to WASM — what flags, what stubs needed for Arduino guards?
2. How should the JS/WASM boundary be designed — embind vs cwrap vs WASM exports directly? What's the cleanest API surface?
3. For `ckbfs_publish` in browser: the signing step needs to go through a CCC signer (async, returns a signature). How do we bridge async JS signing into synchronous C signing? (Asyncify? Promise + callback?)
4. For `ckbfs_fetch_witness` in browser: HTTP calls need to use `fetch()` instead of HTTPClient. Best approach — JS fetch shim exported to C via EM_JS, or pure JS implementation calling WASM for decode only?
5. What does the full npm package structure look like — `@wyltek/ckbfs` with WASM bundle, JS bindings, TypeScript types, React hook `useChainStorage()`?
6. How does the multi-tx split work for files >480KB — what's the APPEND protocol in CKBFS and how do we expose a progress callback across multiple sequential broadcasts?
7. What's the CKB capacity cost model for CKBFS vs inline Spore? Our C code has `ckbfs_estimate_cost()` — port this to JS for the DOB minter cost panel.
8. Are there any existing CKBFS browser implementations (JS/TS) we can reference or diff against?

## [DONE] gameboy-hardware-wallet
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Output:** findings/gameboy-hardware-wallet.md
**Goal:** Investigate feasibility of a retro handheld console (R36S/similar) that functions as a hardware wallet with CKB light client — disguised as a normal gaming device. Inspired by: "10,000 games and one is a wallet."

**Context:**
- R36S runs Batocera Linux (ARM, Rockchip RK3326), full Linux userspace available
- Phill has ESP32 CKB light client + signer already partially built (CKB-ESP32)
- Private key on removable micro SD (kept in safe separately from device)
- Wallet loads as a "ROM" in the game list — normal device to anyone watching
- Specific button combo unlocks wallet mode (like a cheat code)
- The "alternative mode" triggers a separate process/overlay on Batocera

**Questions to answer:**
1. What is the Batocera architecture — EmulationStation frontend, retroarch cores, Linux processes? How do custom apps get added as "games" in the UI?
2. Can a custom binary/script run as a retroarch core? What's the libretro core API — could a CKB light client + signer implement it?
3. What's the button combo interception pattern in Batocera/EmulationStation? How have others added secret modes or overlays?
4. Micro SD key storage: what's the right approach — encrypted private key file, hardware-backed keystore, or just raw key? What are the failure modes (corruption, accidental eject)?
5. What existing projects combine retro gaming hardware with crypto/blockchain (seed phrase entry on gameboy, trezor gameboy case mods, etc)?
6. RetroAchievements integration: how does it work technically? Can we use the same hooks for CKB events instead of game achievements?
7. What display/UX would the wallet screen look like in a Batocera ROM slot — full screen app, retroarch overlay, or EmulationStation scraper art?
8. R36S vs other budget handhelds (RG35XX, Miyoo Mini, Powkiddy RGB30, Anbernic RG28XX, TrimUI Smart Pro) — which have the best Linux access, fastest boot, most RAM for running a light client alongside games? Focus on devices under $60 AUD. Are there any with hardware secure elements or TPM chips?

## [DONE] retroarch-core-blockchain
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Output:** findings/retroarch-core-blockchain.md
**Goal:** Deep dive into the libretro/RetroArch core API to understand what's possible for blockchain-native retro games — in-game token earning, Fiber micropayments for lives/continues, on-chain leaderboards, tradeable game items as CKB DOBs.

**Context:**
- Neon's idea: handheld consoles where traditional points are tokens kids can trade for in-game or platform benefits
- RetroAchievements already tracks game events and awards badges — same hook could award CKB tokens
- A retroarch core IS just a shared library (.so/.dll) implementing the libretro API — you could write one from scratch
- Fiber Network enables sub-second micropayments — perfect for pay-per-life, tournament entry, item trades
- CKB DOBs as game items: sword found in dungeon = DOB minted to your wallet
- The "rom" is just data — a custom core could interpret any file format as a game with blockchain hooks

**Questions to answer:**
1. Full libretro core API surface: retro_run(), retro_serialize(), input polling, audio/video callbacks — what hooks exist for custom logic injection?
2. RetroAchievements technical implementation: how does rcheevos library detect game events? Same pattern usable for token triggers?
3. Can a libretro core make network calls (HTTP/WebSocket) from within retro_run()? Threading model?
4. What's the minimal libretro core that compiles for ARM (R36S/Batocera) — could our CKB light client be the network layer inside a core?
5. Fiber Network payment flow for games: what does a sub-second micropayment look like in code? Invoice → pay → confirm in <1s?
6. Existing blockchain game projects on RetroArch or similar — any prior art?
7. DOB minting from a game event: latency, UX, what does "item found = NFT minted" feel like in practice?
8. Legal/IP considerations: retro game ROMs + blockchain = two complicated areas. Custom cores with original content sidestep this entirely.

## [DONE] retro-achievements-ckb-bridge
**Priority:** LOW
**Output:** findings/retro-achievements-ckb-bridge.md
**Goal:** Map RetroAchievements' existing infrastructure and API to understand what's already solved for game event tracking — then design the delta needed to route those events to CKB instead of (or alongside) RA badges.

**Context:**
- RetroAchievements (RA) is already doing what we want: tracking in-game memory addresses, firing events when conditions are met, awarding badges
- Their rcheevos C library runs inside retroarch cores and has a public API
- If we can hook into rcheevos events and route them to a CKB transaction, the game tracking work is already done
- This is the shortest path to "achievement = on-chain token"

**Questions to answer:**
1. RetroAchievements API: what endpoints exist for reading achievement definitions and submitting unlocks? Can we POST to a custom endpoint instead?
2. rcheevos library: what's the callback interface when an achievement fires? How hard is it to add a second callback that signs a CKB tx?
3. RA achievement format (.json/.cht files): could we define "CKB achievements" in the same format and run them through the same engine?
4. What CKB transaction type makes sense for an achievement unlock — a simple transfer to a "trophy" address, a DOB mint, or a Fiber micropayment?
5. RA has a community of 50,000+ users and 500,000+ achievements across thousands of games. Is there a path to propose CKB as an optional "export" destination for existing achievements?

## [DONE] ckb-light-esp-ckbfs-integration
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Output:** findings/ckb-light-esp-ckbfs-integration.md
**Goal:** Research how CKBFS could be integrated into ckb-light-esp — specifically using an ESP32 to publish small sensor readings, firmware hashes, or hardware provenance records to CKBFS. Understand the constraints: no browser, no JoyID, needs raw CKB transaction building on a microcontroller or lightweight proxy.

2. Can an ESP32 build and sign a CKBFS transaction directly, or does it need a proxy?
3. What's the witness size limit per CKB transaction — can a sensor reading + firmware hash fit in one tx?
4. Is there a lightweight Rust or C CKBFS implementation that could target ESP-IDF?
5. Hardware provenance pattern: ESP32 signs its own firmware hash → publishes to CKBFS → DOB references it. Feasible?

## [DONE] fiberquest-payment-mechanics
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Output:** findings/fiberquest-payment-mechanics.md
**Goal:** Design the payment mechanic models for FiberQuest — how should money map to game events in each genre? Answer: (1) Fighting games — per-damage (proportional shannons to HP lost), per-round, per-match, per-special-move? (2) Sports — per-score, per-quarter, winner-takes-all? (3) Racing — per-position-change, finish-order payout, lap splits? (4) Puzzle/versus — per-garbage-sent, per-line-clear, survival bonus? (5) Co-op brawlers — "pay to revive" model, boss-kill bounty, shared pool? Also: what's the ideal wager size? Too small = meaningless, too large = scary. Recommend default amounts in CKB shannons that feel like arcade quarters — enough to feel real, not enough to hurt. Consider: variable wager (set per session), bracket wager (tournament pot). Also research: have any other projects done game+Lightning payments? What can we learn/differentiate from?

(2) Specifically look for any with 2-player vs mode or link cable multiplayer. (3) RAM map compatibility — do poker games have clean money/chip count addresses that map naturally to Fiber channel balances? (4) The ideal case: a poker game where chip stack in RAM = Fiber channel balance in shannons — completely natural 1:1 mapping. (5) Any arcade poker/gambling games on FinalBurn Neo with RA support. (6) Consider: could we make a game where the GAME ITSELF is the channel UI? Player's chip stack IS their channel balance, updated in real time via WRITE_CORE_MEMORY as payments flow.

(2) Which games work well over Netplay — fighters, sports, puzzle — what's the competitive scene? (3) RetroAchievements + Netplay interaction — do achievements fire for both players? Does RAM state sync between clients? (4) Kaillera, GGPO, FightCade — are any of these accessible via RetroArch cores? FightCave runs FBNeo which is a libretro core — can we hook into it? (5) Latency question: Fiber send_payment is ~20ms. Netplay adds 50-150ms. Is the combined latency acceptable for real-time per-hit payments? Or do we need to batch payments per round instead? (6) Can two players on opposite sides of the world play SF2 over Netplay with Fiber payments? What's the practical distance limit?

## [DONE] fiberquest-custom-protocol
**Priority:** HIGH
**Output:** findings/fiberquest-custom-protocol.md
**Goal:** Research feasibility of a custom protocol layer that connects retro console emulators with Fiber payment channels reliably. Answer: (1) What existing protocols handle real-time game state sync between emulators — GGPO rollback netcode, delay-based, what are the tradeoffs? (2) Could FiberQuest implement a lightweight custom sync protocol ON TOP of RetroArch Netplay — i.e. a sidecar that augments the existing netplay connection with payment events? (3) Alternatively: could we build a standalone game-agnostic payment event bus — two machines run RetroArch independently, our sidecar syncs game state hashes and payment triggers via a separate WebSocket channel? (4) Console-level integration: is there any way to run a Fiber-aware sidecar ON the console hardware itself (e.g., Raspberry Pi running RetroArch, Pi also runs Fiber node, all local)? (5) What would a "FiberQuest Protocol" look like — a lightweight spec for: session handshake, event message format, payment acknowledgement, dispute resolution if one client disagrees on game state? (6) Robustness: what happens if the network drops mid-game? Can we use Fiber's existing channel state as a source of truth for dispute resolution? Design the protocol as if it could become an open standard other game developers adopt.

Specifically: Raspberry Pi 4/5, Orange Pi 5, Odroid, Batocera/Lakka/RetroPie distros — do they have enough RAM/CPU headroom to run FNN alongside RetroArch? What are the resource requirements of FNN (RAM, CPU, storage for chain data)? (2) CKB light client vs full node — which is feasible on these devices? Light client (ckb-light-client) is ~50MB RAM — is that viable alongside RetroArch? What's the sync time? (3) Batocera/Lakka/RetroPie — can we install arbitrary binaries/services? Batocera uses a read-only squashfs overlay, Lakka similar. How do we persist a Fiber node service across reboots on these locked-down distros? Is there a user-data partition we can write to? (4) RetroArch on RetroPie (Raspberry Pi OS based) — full OS access, systemd available — this is the most viable path. How hard is it to add a systemd service to RetroPie? (5) Alternatively: dedicated companion device — a small SBC (Pi Zero 2W, ESP32-S3) that runs only the Fiber node and communicates with the gaming machine over LAN/USB. What's the minimum viable hardware for a Fiber node? (6) What does the user setup flow look like — plug in device, scan QR code, channel funded, ready to play?

## [DONE] fiberquest-esp32s3-node
**Priority:** HIGH
**Output:** findings/fiberquest-esp32s3-node.md
**Goal:** Investigate using an ESP32-S3 (or similar) as a standalone FiberQuest companion device. Cover: (1) Can the ESP32-S3 run a CKB light client or Fiber node? It has 512KB SRAM + up to 8MB PSRAM + 16MB flash — is that enough for a light client? Probably not for a full node. What's the minimum viable embedded CKB implementation? (2) Alternative: ESP32-S3 as a HARDWARE WALLET / SIGNER only — it holds the private key and signs Fiber channel transactions, but the actual node runs on the gaming machine or cloud. This is more realistic. What would this look like? (3) USB HID / USB Serial approach: ESP32-S3 connected via USB to a gaming machine — acts as a hardware wallet dongle. User plugs it in, it identifies as a USB serial device, FiberQuest sidecar communicates with it to sign transactions. (4) BLE approach: ESP32-S3 with BLE — acts as a wireless hardware wallet. FiberQuest sidecar on gaming machine connects via BLE to request signatures. (5) What existing CKB/crypto signing implementations exist for ESP32? Can we use the existing ESP32 CKB key management from the NerdMiner CKB project or ckb-light-esp? (6) Physical form factor ideas: small PCB that clips onto a controller, or fits in a cartridge slot, or acts as a "FiberQuest cartridge". Rate feasibility for hackathon timeline.

**Output:** findings/fiberquest-web-client.md
**Goal:** Research building a web-based FiberQuest client — playing FiberQuest games directly in a browser with Fiber payments. Cover: (1) WebAssembly RetroArch — RetroArch has a web player (https://web.libretro.com/), does it expose the network control interface (UDP port 55355) to JavaScript? Or can we access emulator memory via WASM exports? (2) CKB/Fiber in the browser — CCC (CKBer's Codebase) already runs in browser. Does Fiber have a browser-compatible JS SDK? Can we connect to a Fiber node via WebSocket from a browser? (3) The ideal web flow: open browser → connect JoyID wallet → game loads in browser tab → Fiber channel opens → play with per-event payments → channel settles → done. No installation required. (4) Fallback: web DASHBOARD only (no in-browser game) — browser shows live channel balance, payment feed, game state while RetroArch runs natively. This is simpler and more achievable. (5) WebRTC for P2P game state sync between two browser tabs or two machines — could replace RetroArch Netplay for certain simple games. (6) What's the lightest possible web experience — a single HTML page that connects to a local Fiber node RPC and shows live payment activity while the user plays RetroArch natively?

## [DONE] fiberquest-console-hub-protocols
**Priority:** HIGH
**Output:** findings/fiberquest-console-hub-protocols.md
**Goal:** Research existing console multiplayer connectivity protocols that could be emulated by an ESP32-S3 or ESP32-P4 acting as a central hub. Cover each major console's link/multiplayer protocol in detail: (1) SNES Multi-tap / serial link — protocol, baud rate, signal levels, timing, what does the SNES expect to see on the serial pins? Is this SPI, UART, proprietary? (2) Game Boy Link Cable — Serial Clock, Serial Data, clock speed, master/slave arbitration, how does the GB handle 2/4 player via Game Boy Printer adapter or 4-player adapter? (3) NES Four Score / Satellite — how does the NES 4-player adapter work at the electrical/protocol level? (4) Sega Genesis 6-button controller port / Team Player — EA 4-player adapter protocol, Genesis multitap, electrical spec (DE-9 connector pinout, voltage levels). (5) N64 Joybus protocol — used for controllers, memory paks, Rumble Pak, Transfer Pak. Could an ESP32 emulate a Joybus device? (6) GBA Link Cable — what protocol? What chips? 115200 baud serial? (7) For each: what GPIO/peripheral on ESP32-S3 or ESP32-P4 could implement it? SPI, I2S, UART, RMT, bit-banging? What voltage level shifting is needed (3.3V vs 5V)? (8) Are there existing Arduino/ESP32 projects that have already done any of this? GitHub repos? (9) The prize insight: if our hub can speak native console protocols, games don't need to know about Fiber AT ALL — multiplayer just works as designed, and our hub invisibly handles the payment layer. This is extraordinary.

## [DONE] fiberquest-esp32p4-capabilities
**Priority:** HIGH
**Output:** findings/fiberquest-esp32p4-capabilities.md
**Goal:** Deep dive on ESP32-P4 capabilities for a console connectivity hub. The ESP32-P4 is Espressif's latest high-performance SoC. Cover: (1) CPU: dual-core RISC-V P4 at 400MHz — how does this compare to ESP32-S3 for real-time protocol emulation? Is 400MHz enough for bit-banging SNES link at the right timing? (2) Memory: 768KB SRAM + external PSRAM support up to 32MB — enough to buffer game states from multiple consoles simultaneously? (3) Peripherals: USB 2.0 HS OTG (480Mbps), MIPI CSI/DSI, SDIO, I2S, SPI x3, UART x3 — which of these map to console protocols? USB HS could connect directly to modern USB controllers/adapters. (4) GPIO: how many available for parallel console port emulation? (5) Real-time: does ESP32-P4 support real-time priority tasks suitable for microsecond-level protocol timing? (6) ESP32-P4 vs ESP32-S3 for this use case — is P4 significantly better, or is S3 sufficient? (7) Any existing console emulation projects on ESP32-P4? (8) Power: can the P4 run off USB power while also powering 4 console ports?

## [DONE] fiberquest-hub-architecture
**Priority:** HIGH
**Output:** findings/fiberquest-hub-architecture.md
**Goal:** Design the FiberQuest Hub — a physical device based on ESP32-P4 (or S3) that acts as a central multiplayer hub for retro consoles, invisibly integrating Fiber payments. Answer: (1) Physical design: what does it look like? A box with N console controller ports + WiFi + small display? Or a dongle that plugs into one console and connects others via wireless? (2) Protocol bridge: how does it translate between console A's native protocol and console B's native protocol in real time? Does it need to re-implement the game's multiplayer logic, or just relay signals? (3) The key insight — if RetroArch is involved, we don't need to emulate hardware protocols at all! We can use RetroArch Netplay (software) + our sidecar for payments. The hardware hub becomes relevant only for REAL hardware consoles. Which approach is better for the hackathon? (4) Hybrid approach: hub supports BOTH — real hardware consoles via native protocols AND RetroArch via Netplay/UDP — same payment layer underneath. (5) What does the Fiber payment integration look like at the hub level? Hub has its own Fiber node? Or connects to a Pi? Hub holds the escrow? (6) Minimum viable hub for hackathon demo: what's the simplest hardware that proves the concept? One SNES with two controllers? Two Game Boys linked wirelessly? Two RetroArch instances + sidecar? (7) What would make this commercially viable after the hackathon? Build-to-order? Open hardware? License the protocol?

## [DONE] esp32p4-snes-emulator-viability
**Priority:** HIGH
**Output:** findings/esp32p4-snes-emulator-viability.md
**Goal:** Research viability of running a SNES or NES emulator directly on ESP32-P4. Key questions: (1) ESP32-P4 specs vs SNES/NES requirements — CPU clock (400MHz RISC-V), RAM (768KB SRAM + PSRAM), are these sufficient? SNES CPU is 3.58MHz 65816, RAM 128KB — but emulation overhead is typically 10-50x. NES is 1.79MHz 6502, 2KB RAM — much lighter. (2) Are there existing ESP32 SNES or NES emulator projects? nofrendo (NES) runs on ESP32 original. Any SNES emulator on ESP32? SNES9x or PocketSNES has been ported to small hardware before. (3) What display would be needed? ESP32-P4 has MIPI DSI — can drive ILI9341/ST7789 or a small LCD directly. What resolution is needed for SNES (256x224)? (4) Audio: SNES has SPC700 audio chip — is software emulation of this feasible on P4 with I2S output? (5) If SNES is not viable, what about NES? nofrendo on ESP32-S3 is confirmed — P4 at 400MHz should be significantly better. (6) Critical: if the ESP32-P4 is running an emulator, what CPU headroom remains for: WiFi stack, Fiber signing (secp256k1 or blake2b hashing), CKB light client operations? Can these coexist or does emulation consume 100% of CPU? (7) Recommended architecture: emulator on one core, WiFi/payment on second core? FreeRTOS task priorities?

## [DONE] esp32p4-fiber-signer-vs-lightclient
**Priority:** HIGH
**Output:** findings/esp32p4-fiber-signer-vs-lightclient.md
**Goal:** Compare two architectures for ESP32-P4 in FiberQuest: (A) Fiber Signer Only — ESP32-P4 holds private key, signs CKB L1 transactions via USB/BLE, a Pi or server runs the actual Fiber node. (B) Light Client + Signer — ESP32-P4 runs a CKB light client AND signs transactions, becoming a more autonomous node. For each: (1) What software exists? CKB light client is Rust — can it compile for RISC-V ESP32-P4? What are the binary size and RAM requirements? (2) Fiber Network Node (FNN) is also Rust — same question. FNN is heavier than just a light client. (3) Signing only: secp256k1 library for ESP32 exists (Bitcoin hardware wallets use this). Memory footprint? (4) Our existing ckb-light-esp project — what CKB operations does it already do on ESP32? Can it sign secp256k1 transactions? (5) For Fiber specifically: channel open/close = CKB L1 tx (needs signing). send_payment = off-chain message (needs signing of payment hash only, much lighter). Which operations actually need to run on-device vs can be delegated? (6) Verdict: is "signer only" sufficient for a self-contained FiberQuest device, or do you need a light client to verify channel state independently?

## [DONE] retroachievements-live-api-payment-triggers
**Priority:** HIGH
**Output:** findings/retroachievements-live-api-payment-triggers.md
**Goal:** Research using RetroAchievements (RA) data as live payment triggers for FiberQuest. Two angles: (1) RA Rich Presence protocol — RA games include Rich Presence scripts that read RAM addresses and format live game state strings (e.g. "Playing as Mario, World 1-2, Lives: 3"). These scripts are essentially pre-written RAM maps maintained by the RA community. Can we parse RA Rich Presence scripts to get RAM addresses and game state logic for free, without writing our own RAM maps? URL: https://docs.retroachievements.org/developer-docs/rich-presence.html (2) RA Achievement definitions — each achievement has conditions tied to specific RAM addresses and values. These are machine-readable. Can we parse achievement conditions to detect game events? E.g. "Player dealt damage" = perfect payment trigger. URL: https://docs.retroachievements.org/developer-docs/achievement-development-overview.html (3) RA API — is there a live/websocket API, or only a REST polling API? Can we query current game state, active achievements, rich presence string in real-time? Rate limits? Auth requirements? (4) RetroArch + RA integration — RetroArch already talks to RA servers. Can we hook into RetroArch's existing RA client to get achievement unlock events locally, without hitting the RA API at all? Is there a local event/callback system? (5) Practical: for SF2 Turbo SNES, does RA have a rich presence script that reads health values? If yes, those RAM addresses are already verified and community-maintained — we can use them directly.

## [DONE] fiberquest-sdk-design
**Priority:** HIGH
**Added:** 2026-03-05
**Goal:** Design the FiberQuest SDK architecture — the reusable framework that lets anyone add a Fiber economy to any SNES ROM without touching emulator C code. Key questions: (1) What does the RAM map JSON schema look like? (2) What does the payment rules config look like (trigger condition, direction IN/OUT, amount formula, debounce, label)? (3) How does the SDK expose events to the overlay and to Fiber? (4) What does "adding a new game" look like as a developer workflow? (5) How does the SDK handle bidirectional channels (both earn and spend in same session)? Design this to be publishable as an npm package or C header.

**Added:** 2026-03-06
**Goal:** Deep analysis of what CKB is missing for widespread developer and user adoption — infrastructure gaps, UX gaps, ecosystem gaps. Specific angles: (1) Onboarding — how hard is it for a new developer to ship their first CKB dApp today vs Ethereum/Solana? What's the friction? (2) Tooling gaps — what does every Ethereum dev take for granted (Hardhat, Foundry, The Graph, ethers.js, OpenZeppelin) that doesn't exist on CKB? (3) Mobile — is there a CKB mobile SDK? Can you build a React Native app that interacts with CKB? (4) Gasless UX — does CKB have meta-transactions or account abstraction for removing the "user needs CKB to do anything" UX problem? (5) Oracle infrastructure — is there a Chainlink equivalent on CKB? Any price feeds? (6) Cross-chain bridges — what's the state of bridging USDC, ETH, BTC onto CKB for liquidity? (7) Smart contract composability — how does CKB's cell model compare to EVM composability? What patterns exist for multi-contract interactions? (8) Data availability — can you store meaningful app state on CKB cheaply, or does the capacity model make this prohibitive? (9) Event/notification infrastructure — how do apps listen for on-chain events without running a full node? (10) Testing infrastructure — is there a CKB devnet/testnet that's easy to spin up locally?

Key questions: (1) How do you design a Type Script that enforces a state machine (OPEN→LOCKED→ACTIVE→SETTLED) — what does the script validation logic look like in pseudo-code? (2) How do you link two cells (tournament cell + escrow cell) by ID and enforce that both are consumed together in settlement tx? (3) What is the minimum cell capacity needed for a tournament cell with ~500 bytes of JSON data? (4) How does the "editable until lock_time" pattern work — can a Type Script read the current block timestamp to enforce time-based rules?

**Priority:** HIGH
**Added:** 2026-03-06
**Goal:** Research patterns for multi-party escrow on CKB — specifically for tournament prize pools that accumulate entry fees from multiple players and distribute to winners. Key questions: (1) What's the cleanest pattern for an escrow cell that grows as players register (each registration tx adds to the escrow balance)? (2) How do you enforce entry fee payment atomically with tournament cell registration in a single tx? (3) For entry-fee-only tournaments, how do you prove the escrow balance = sum of all entry fees on-chain? (4) What's the best pattern for batch payouts — one tx that outputs to N winners simultaneously? (5) How do you handle automatic refunds if min_players not met — can a Type Script enforce this, or does it require the agent to initiate the tx? (6) Any Fiber Network patterns for holding funds in escrow pending a future event?
